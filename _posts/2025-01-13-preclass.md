Welcome to Math 6040/7260: *Linear Models*. Here is some essential information to get started with Math 6040/7260.

## Class webpage

Please bookmark and visit the course webpage frequently for the most updated information:

## Lecture format

I will deliver lectures in Commons 337 (Newcomb Institute) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (Mon/Wed/Fri 1:00 pm - 1:50 pm).  Friday classes will  consist a mixture of lectures (first 2 to 3 weeks) and practical lab sessions.  Lectures will include presentation slides and questions.

## Attendance

I do require attendance.  However, reasonable absence will not be punished.


## Grades

There will be one mid-term and one final exam.  There will be roughly 4 sets of homework problems.

All graduate students are required to deliver a 15-min talk (10 min presentation + 5 min questions) on one of the following topics (secure yours before others do).  You may suggest a topic outside of the pool too.  Undergraduate students are encouraged to participate too with bonus 5 points towards the final score.
